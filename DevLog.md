- This is an example log to showcase how we can log all our work done on this project. I started a tiny bit of documentation in our README today as well as am currently trying to set up this log. Things I want to get done today will be discussing the framework we plan to make with you guys as well as possibly using github Projects feature as its very neat and organized but would have a learning curve for all of us, therefore it could be unnecessary. ( You could just write general notes about what you did as another source of us all to be on the same page. Also acts as a timeline for us to follow... you would do this after your work is done and then push ur changes to github. )

- I set up a general directory layout to keep our code clean (We can edit it or revise it however you guys want!), I also made a home/landing page... No current body content on the page wanted to see if you guys wanted to make this a main page or just an entry point... currently did it in a html not a php file as we won't need any database connection for this page in the foreseeable future. Also set up some of the css. Tried to comment super well on everything I could!
