- This is an example log to showcase how we can log all our work done on this project. I started a tiny bit of documentation in our README today as well as am currently trying to set up this log. Things I want to get done today will be discussing the framework we plan to make with you guys as well as possibly using github Projects feature as its very neat and organized but would have a learning curve for all of us, therefore it could be unnecessary. ( You could just write general notes about what you did as another source of us all to be on the same page. Also acts as a timeline for us to follow... you would do this after your work is done and then push ur changes to github. )

- I set up a general directory layout to keep our code clean (We can edit it or revise it however you guys want!), I also made a home/landing page... No current body content on the page wanted to see if you guys wanted to make this a main page or just an entry point... currently did it in a html not a php file as we won't need any database connection for this page in the foreseeable future. Also set up some of the css. Tried to comment super well on everything I could!

- I set up the other pages htmls, just copy and pasted the home for the main layout each page will maintain and now the nav is set up. I also drew up some wireframes that Shaima and I are going to work off for the Ui layouts. Did some more bootstrap formating like making the nav-link titles bold... Also set up a subpage off the Login page that has a register now page set up for users that aren't registered. Probably going to set up temp jsons over doing the SQL soon and get user authentication in place as we work on the UI and maybe a little back-end too. Main worry I have right now is how to manage login states across pages I forgot how it works. Will probably do some work tonight (2.12 Wednesday) I did this last night and never pushed it.. Committing it now.

- I have started to work onto the functionality of the html pages and the JavaScript necessary. I did some changes for the BookDirectory.html in order to implement a search bar and make sure the items appear as they should after the search. I have also done some changes in the style.css for the mentioned search bar, and will continue further into making sure that what is implemented and functional. Let me know if there exists any error of what is added or not necessary, and if something needs to be worked on as soon as possible.

- I began creating and uploaded a basic database consisting of 20 books. If we have more time for the project, we can add more books in the future. The database consists of the following: id (auto incremented), name, genre, author, published date. All there is left to do database wise is figure out a way to store jpg files so that books can appear more visibly on our website. I will continue to explore and do research in regards to this sometime this weekend. When that is finished, I'll make sure to polish the SQL file with comments so that it is easily readable as well.
